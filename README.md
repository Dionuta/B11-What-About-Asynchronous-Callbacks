<p>A deep dive into the strange world of JavaScript.</p>

<h1>What Was Learned</h1>
    
 <ul>

  <li>Asynchronous</li>
  <li>Event Queue</li>

 </ul>
 
<h1>Notes</h1>
Asynchronous - more than one at a time.
When the execution stack is empty, the javascript look at the Event Queue. If something is their javascript waits for the event to be triggered when that happens the execution context for the event is  created. Javascript is no asynchronous the broswer Asynchronous put things into th event queue.
